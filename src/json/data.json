      "description": "We ordered the Curry and the Tokyo Bowl. Both were amazing ! Really recommend this place. I also tried the Lettuce wraps but they were more like lettuce tacos. Not the best. But the bowls were fire ! Also the hot spiked tea was great too. The staff was extremely welcoming and helpful. The ambiance was great. Truly a local hidden gem!",

      "description": "Excellent wine list, cocktails, service , food.  Pricy but it is a ski town.  A little too crowded during a pandemic.  However if you have your shots, go for it.  Definitely worth a visit.",
